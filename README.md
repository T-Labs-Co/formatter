        if (strlen($value) > 100) {
            return substr($value, 0, 100);
        }

        return $value;
    }
}
// Using with custom rule
use TLabsCo\Formatter\Formatter;

$formatterRules = [
    'title' => 'trim|replace:Local Composer Dependencies,[Local Composer Dependencies]|replace:[Local Composer Dependencies],[Composer Dependencies]|limit:150',
    'publish_date' => 'date_format:Y-m-d',
    'short_description' => ['trim', new Max100FormatRule()],
];

$data = [
    'title' => '  How to resolve missing Local Composer Dependencies on CentOS 8?  ',
    'publish_date' => '2024/05/02 13:00',
    'short_description' => 'Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description Very long description '
